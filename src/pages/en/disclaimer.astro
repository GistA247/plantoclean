            As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on
            these pages in accordance with general legislation pursuant to
            § 7 para. 1 TMG (German Telemedia Act). However, according to
            §§ 8 to 10 TMG, we as a service provider are not obligated to
            monitor transmitted or stored third-party information, or to
            investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity.

          <p>
            Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general
            law remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only
            possible from the point in time at which a concrete infringement
            becomes known. If we become aware of any such infringements, we
            will remove this content immediately.

            Our website contains links to external websites of third parties
            over whose content we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot
            accept any liability for this third-party content. The respective
            provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the
            content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for
            possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal content
            was not recognizable at the time of linking.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, permanent monitoring of the content of the linked pages
            is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a violation of law.
            If we become aware of any infringements, we will remove such links
            immediately.
